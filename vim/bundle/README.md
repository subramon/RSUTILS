# vim-ispc

Syntax highlighting for [ISPC](https://ispc.github.io/), packaged up as a
Pathogen/Vundle plugin.

This is Intel's code, taken directly from the `contrib/` directory of their
project. See LICENSE.

## Installation

Use your favorite plugin manager. If you don't have one, I'd recommend Vundle,
though you should probably also take a look at Pathogen, as it's more common.

```
# if your ~/.vim folder isn't under source control:
git clone https://github.com/jez/vim-ispc ~/.vim/bundle/

# if your ~/.vim folder is under source control:
git submodule add https://github.com/jez/vim-ispc ~/.vim/bundle/
```
