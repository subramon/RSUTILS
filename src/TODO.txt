Use https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clock_gettime.2.html
Don't do that -using yourself directly the RDTSC machine instruction- (because your OS scheduler could reschedule other threads or processes at arbitrary moments, or slow down the clock). Use a function provided by your library or OS.

My main objective is to avoid the need to perform system call every time I want to know the system time
On Linux, read time(7) then use clock_gettime(2) which is really quick (and does not involve any slow system call) thanks to vdso(7).
===========================================

gen_files should read .c files from a file and execute in loop
